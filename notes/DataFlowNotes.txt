Any particular reason edges live in the nodes in the Flowgraph?
A: not really

Do I have to iterate through SCCs or can I use a single workqueue instead?
A: Yes its better, do the simple way first

I don't really like the WALA CFG for data-flow. It is over basic blocks so no generated exceptions from instructions
A: It actual does the right thing apparently

For a data-flow analysis with side effects (e.g. printing) do I have to keep a set of visited nodes, this seems a bit hackish, but to avoid duplicates it might be unavoidable (we don't want to reanalyze).

Should null data-flow items be allowed? Should they be propagated?
Polyglot says yes for the first and no for the second

Do I actually need a lattice and confluence or should I let the individual analysis decide how to compute the meet of the incoming edges (if they even need to).

Do we actually need to hashcons the varcontexts?

Widen is never not the same as upperbound.
