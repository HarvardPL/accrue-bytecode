Flow sensitive issues

- Remove duplicates needs looking into

- Some of the dependencies seem to be per DestinationQuery, it may be worth storing them there

- Need to make sure we never use the type inference results for exceptions thrown by callees, seems like it is always NPE for non-static and Throwable for static calls

- Do we want to special case Object.<init> in the pp reachability stuff. It never does anything and is always the same.

XXX Fix data-flow framework to correctly analyze the static initializers before the main method (before fakeroot?)

XXX I don't think this will work for offline registration, consider that class init methods can be added to the fake root changing the program point graph


Flow-insensitive fixes

- handle loadMetadata in flow-insensitive

- fix the allocation of singletons for native methods in the flow-insensitive analysis

- Need to make sure "TypeReference.isPrimitiveType" is being used correctly in the main branch RE: null is a primitive type (NonNullResults.isNonNull, NonNullDataFlow.call)
