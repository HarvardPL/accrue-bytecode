Flow sensitive issues

- Remove duplicates needs looking into

- Reachability is used even after the ptg is finished (i.e. to get the points-to sets during the non-null analysis)

- Need to make sure "TypeReference.isPrimitiveType" is being used correctly in the main branch RE: null is a primitive type (NonNullResults.isNonNull, NonNullDataFlow.call)

- Add clinits for singleton allocation sites

- Interval analysis

- Cast removal analysis

- Is computing relevant nodes multiple times more expensive than searching through irrelevant nodes for some sources?

- Some of the dependencies seem to be per DestinationQuery, it may be worth storing them there


TODO

X 1. Outline
X 2. ECOOP format
3. Relevant nodes
depth first search by edge
- if the call edge is on the stack then a return edge prunes
- use nodes for success (target or relevent)
for correctness try all paths

Fix data-flow framework to correctly analyze the static initializers before the main method (before fakeroot?)
