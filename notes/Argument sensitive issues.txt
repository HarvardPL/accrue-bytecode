Argument sensitive issues

- For type sensitive what is the context for static calls 
    - Could use the caller context and pushing on a list of the allocating class of the arguments
    - This feels more call-site sensitive
    - Maybe just do nothing? (make it the same as caller context) 
- What happens when the points-to set for one of the arguments is empty? 
    - Right now I'm setting that slot to "null"
    - This could result in extra/wasted analysis if it is empty then becomes not empty 
- How should deltas be handled in the argument iterator
    - Right now I take a delta and match it up against everything in the points-to sets of the other arguments then move onto the next delta
    - This repeats some because the deltas will also be in the full sets
    - For deltas that have already been visited only "points-to set \ delta" should be iterated when going through the other deltas
