XXX Make sure the procedure name is just the procedure name and does not include the context

TODO no need for {v1} after "this" for variable names

TODO Gen exceptions should carry the PC? They didn't in Infoflow, fix this in Infoflow

OK TODO Should array.length be treated like a normal field (an edge from the pointer to the "length" field) or just have an edge from the array?

TODO if we are not careful two different threads could get two different reference variables for a string literal field, in general the ReferenceVariableFactory is not threadsafe

TODO signature for getClassLoader() etc

TODO why are there so many more nodes and edges

TODO mark Native nodes as "estimated type"

TODO remove trailing semicolon from callgraph

XXX Policy 2 for tax doesn't work, we can get explicit flows, but not PC flows. Same with the infoflow version, not sure when it broke, I thought I reran everything before CCS

TODO filename can be too long when printing out precise ex results

TODO all flags in StatementRegistrar should be full-fleged options

TODO option to not use signature for non-native methods

TODO make it so the native methods used for the String signatures do not throw exceptions (at least in the PDG)

TODO make sure the native methods for String don't cause issues with the context being too deep, maybe they don't count?

XXX Seem to be NPEs for field accesses to "this" 

TODO More tests for HAF parsing
 
XXX clinit sneaking in twice when we turn off "seenInstanceOf" in the registrar
