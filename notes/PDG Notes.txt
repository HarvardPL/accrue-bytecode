XXX Make sure the procedure name is just the procedure name and does not include the context

XXX PC MERGE nodes in the same context, but for different program points are getting confused

TODO no need for {v1} after "this" for variable names

XXX What should the PDG look like for Exceptions when they are unique, what about calls on these exceptions, they should have a receiver even if it is init(), yes?

XXX Gen exceptions should carry the PC? They didn't in Infoflow

XXX Should array.length be treated like a normal field (an edge from the pointer to the "length" field) or just have an edge from the array?

XXX USE_SINGLE_ALLOC_FOR_PRIMITIVE_ARRAYS isn't working right, probably the same reason as the exception thing
