XXX Make sure the procedure name is just the procedure name and does not include the context

XXX PC MERGE nodes in the same context, but for different program points are getting confused

TODO no need for {v1} after "this" for variable names

XXX Gen exceptions should carry the PC? They didn't in Infoflow, fix this

OK TODO Should array.length be treated like a normal field (an edge from the pointer to the "length" field) or just have an edge from the array?

TODO if we are not careful two different threads could get two different reference variables for a string literal field, in general the ReferenceVariableFactory is not threadsafe

TODO signature for getClassLoader() etc

TODO why are there so many more nodes and edges

TODO mark Native nodes as "estimated type"

TODO remove trailing semicolon from callgraph

XXX Policy 2 for tax doesn't work, we can get explicit flows, but not PC flows. Same with the infoflow version, not sure when it broke, I thought I reran everything before CCS

TODO filename can be too long when printing out precise ex results
