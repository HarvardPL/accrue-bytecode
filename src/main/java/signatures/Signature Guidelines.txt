Any class in the signatures.library package will be used to create signatures for "real" library classes.

For example signatures.library.java.lang.System will be used to replace methods in java.lang.System.

Only methods in the signature class will replace those in the "real" class.

How this works:

1. During analysis when requesting IR for a resolved method, before asking WALA for the IR look for a corresponding 
   signature for that method
2. If there is a signature for the given method then get the IR for the signature
3. If there are any field accesses or method invocations where the receiver is a signature type then replace that 
   method with the corresponding "real" type if that "real" type has the same field or method with the same signature.
   This means that we can initialize fields in a signature class and the results will reflect on the field in the "real" 
   class. It also means that we can use methods and fields in the signature class and they will be changed to the "real"
   fields and methods.
4. Recreate the IR using the "real" method and instructions from 3.

Gotchas:

1. Don't use anonymous classes in signatures they will end up being replaced with anonymous classes from the "real" class
2. If you "cast" or use "instanceof" with types from the signature library, the types will not be replaced.
3. Be careful with constructors, if you do not implement a no-arg, make sure there is not a no-arg 
   constructor in the real class as this will be overwritten by the default constructor
4. Do not create and use static fields that are not in the original class. This will cause the class initializer for the 
   "real" class to get called twice (once when the class is initialized and once when the signature class is initialized).
