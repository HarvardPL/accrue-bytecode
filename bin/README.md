This directory primarily contains scripts for testing Accrue analyses. Before
running the scripts, you will want to do the following:
- Set the `ACCRUE_BYTECODE` environment variable to the top-level Accrue
directory; and
- Run the command `mvn package` from the top-level Accrue directory to build
Accrue and get the necessary dependencies for the tests.
